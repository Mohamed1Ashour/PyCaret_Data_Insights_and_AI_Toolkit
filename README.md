```
# Usage
To use this toolkit, follow these steps:

1- Run the Python script, which will launch a web-based interface using Streamlit.
2- Upload a dataset in one of the supported formats (CSV, XLS, XLSX, DTA).
3- Select one of the available functions from the sidebar to perform specific data analysis tasks.
Explore and analyze your data using the chosen function's features.

# Function
# Data Description
Provides an overview of the dataset, including basic statistics and data types.

# Statistics
Generates statistical summaries for numerical columns in the dataset.

# Outliers and Missing Values
Allows users to:
Show the percentage of outliers in columns.
Handle missing values using PyCaret's built-in methods.
Remove outliers from the dataset.

# Data Transformation
Applies the "pd.get_dummies" method to convert categorical variables into one-hot encoded format.

# Plots
Offers a variety of plots for data visualization, including histograms, KDE plots, ECDF plots, regression plots, scatter plots, line plots, box plots, count plots, bar plots, and point plots.

# Model Evaluation
Performs model evaluation for both regression and classification tasks, including options for cross-validation.

# Examples
Here are some example use cases for this toolkit:

- Exploring and understanding the basic characteristics of a dataset.
- Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
- Handling missing values and outliers.
- Preparing data for machine learning by transforming categorical variables.
- Evaluating regression and classification models with or without cross-validation.
  
# Dependencies
This toolkit relies on the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
PyCaret: A machine learning library that simplifies model training and evaluation
